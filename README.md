# Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis:
The concept for a new bike sharing business in Des Moines, Iowa is being analyzed.  As a template, we are looking into Citibike data from New York City.

## Results:
We found the following to be of interest in our analysis:

* Gender Breakdown
  * Approximately 65% of users identify as male, 25% identify as female and the remaining 10% are unknown.
* Customer Type
  * Approximately 81% of users are subscribers.
* Checkout Time for Users
  * The most common trip duration is 5 minutes while anything over 25 minutes occurs infrequently.
* Checkout Times by Gender
  * Although the sample size is much smaller, female and unknown gender show a slightly higher average trip duration than male.
* Trips by Weekday per Hour
  * On weekdays, the most common times for rides are from 6:00 - 9:00 AM and 4:00 - 8:00 PM.  Weekend rides occur most frequently mid day.
* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
  * The most frequent ride times (6:00 - 9:00 AM & 4:00 - 8:00 PM weekdays; mid day on weekends) seem to be consistent regardless of gender.
* User Trips by Gender by Weekday
  * Wednesday appears to be an unpopular day for rides (furthest from the weekend?) while Thursday and Friday show frequent rides.

## Summary: 
The majority of the riders are male subscribers riding on weekday mornings, weekday late afternoon early evening and mid day weekeends.  With this in mind, it would be beneficial to determine ways to increase business in off hours.
